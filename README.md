# RepoSpace
A tool built to organize repositories and save them for offline viewing with a simpler ui. The goal is to finish this into a desktop application for cross-platform use and a web-app for work on the go. 

Features;
*Light/Dark mode theme
*Save repos for offline viewing
*Browse saved repos
*Link to GitHub personal account and repositories
*More features coming soon*

I am building this inside Termux proot-distro Debian 12 and having both VS-Code and a browser with tabs is cpu heavy. Not to mention the cluster of controls Github has can be overwhelming sometimes so I made the ui simpler and more focused aiming to be lighter and faster. I hope to help devs like me or on older hardware (maybe even where internet isn't so reliable) with this project. The save function categorizes repos by type or you could create your own category and view it later offline. Never lose a repo in your downloads folder ever again (I know I have more than once and had to re-download). 
Huge thanks to Termux devs and Github! 

This project is still under development and any contributions or issues found are welcome to be discussed.
